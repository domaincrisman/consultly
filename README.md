All data pertaining to each new session will be relative to the currently logged in user. The primary focus is to provide an entrepreneurial consultant a platform to receive payments, communicate with clients, and book sessions without exchanging a lot of emails or phone calls.

Also include a support for an admin user role to manage users, see upcoming sessions that have been booked, as well as manage the application.
